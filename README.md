# Mountain Travel

This is just a page of a fictitious travel company. I have made this page to checkout the beauty of real CSS without the use of any library such as Bootstrap or Semantic UI.

### Features :
* This web page has lots of media queries written, hence it is very responsive to screen size.
* Use of Flexbox.
* Some starter animations.

Visit the web page [here](https://rishisethia258.github.io/Mountain-Travel/).
